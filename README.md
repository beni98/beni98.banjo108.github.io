<h1>emulatorjs</h1>

A javascript emulator for nes, snes, and more!
The BEST emulator on the internet. No ads and self hosted!

<p>demo: <a href=https://ethanaobrien.github.io/emulatorjs/>https://ethanaobrien.github.io/emulatorjs/</a></p>

<p>I have made a google chrome extension using this code <a href=https://github.com/ethanaobrien/emulatorjs-chrome-extension>here</a> - Does not need webserver.</p>

<h1>Where did I get this?</h1>
<p>So I found this website called <a href=https://www.emulatorjs.com/>emulatorjs</a> and I went into inspect and downloaded the resources. I removed the ad server, and made everything work within your own domain.</p>
<p>EMULATOR JS PEOPLE - I looked everywhere and found no terms of service on your site.</p>

<p>The emulator is not illegal - the rom is - I am not responsible for what people decide to do with this software.</p>


<h1>IF YOU WOULD LIKE ANOTHER SYSTEM</h1>
<p>Check if the system is on <a href=https://www.emulatorjs.com/>emulatorjs.com</a>. If it is then open an issue asking for the system you would like to emulate.</p>

<h1>HOW TO</h1>

Download this repository (Code > Download as zip) then Extract the contents

<p>MUST HOST ON WEB SERVER!! (I use <a href=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en>Web Server for Chrome</a> but you are welcome to use what you like)</p>

All of the paths are relative, all files MUST stay where they are

The html that has the emulator embedded in it MUST be in the same directory as all of the files.

If you have questions, ask me and I will clarify (use the issues tab)

Just so you know - You DO NOT NEED the bios for most games / systems, even if it is listed.

Roms can be zipped into .zip archive or .7z archive
